#Multi-Dimensional Array Sum

[slides](http://slides.com/seemaullal/reacto-3)
### Write a function that computes the sum of a multi-dimensional array. ###

#### Problem ####
You have an array that consists of subarrays that are of varying length. These subarrays might be nested infinitely deep. Write a function to find the sum of each element in the array. You may not use any Array methods such as reduce (the only Array method you can use is Array.isArray()).


#### Examples ####

``` javascript
arraySum([1,2,3,4]); //should return  10
arraySum([ [2,4] , [1], [4,2,1] ]); //should return  14
arraySum([ 2, [3,4], 5, [-3, [6 , [ 4,5 ] ] ] ]); //should return  26
```
